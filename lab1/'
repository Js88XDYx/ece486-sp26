\subsection*{Discussion of Variation of $\zeta$ with $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ \score 5}
(As $\zeta$ decreases, how does $M_p$ change? As $\zeta$ decreases, how about $t_r$ and $t_s$?)
Decreasing $\zeta$ causes $M_p$ to increase, as the reduced damping leads to an increased 
overshoot. 
It also causes $t_r$ to decrease, while $t_s$ decreases as $\zeta$ goes from 2 to about 0.7, 
then increases again, with overdamping increasing the time required to reach the steady state
value to begin with and underdamping causing oscillations before the value settles down.


\section*{Question 2 \score 15}

\subsection*{Effect of $\zeta$ on Pole Locations \score 5}
(Solve for poles in terms of $\zeta$ and sketch a plot of trajectory of pole locations [you can use {\sc Matlab\RR}] when $\zeta$ varies.)
The poles of the transfer function are the roots of $s^2+2\zeta\omega_ns+\omega^2_n$,
which can be found with the quadratic formula: 

\begin{center}
	$\frac{-2\zeta\omega_n \pm \sqrt{(2\zeta\omega_n)^2-4(1)\omega^2}}{2}$
	$ = -\zeta\omega_n \pm \omega_n\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}
\end{center}
\subsection*{Effect of Pole Locations on $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ for an Underdamped System \score 5}
(What is the value of $\zeta$ when a system is \emph{underdamped}? As $\zeta$ increases, what happens to $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$?)

\subsection*{Effect of Pole Locations on $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ for an Overdamped/Critically Damped System \score 5}
(What is the value of $\zeta$ when a system is \emph{overdamped}? \emph{Critically damped}? And as $\zeta$ increases, what happens to $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$?)

\section*{Question 3 \score 10}

\subsection*{Comparison of $2^{\rm nd}$ Order System with $1^{\rm st}$ Order System with Dominant Pole \score 6}
(What are the similarities/differences between the response of an overdamped $2^{\rm nd}$ order system to the response of a $1^{\rm st}$ order system with the \emph{dominant} (less negative, closer to the origin) pole of the $2^{\rm nd}$ order's poles?)

\subsection*{Effect of $\zeta$ on Accuracy of Approximation \score 4}
(What is the effect of magnitude of $\zeta$ on the accuracy of the approximations? Also include your graphs.)
